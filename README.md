# Assignment : Python Data Structure
This repository contains the assignment for the Data Science course. The assignment includes 35 questions designed to test and improve your understanding of various data structures in Python, such as lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.

## Questions
1. Write a code to reverse a string
2. Write code to count the number of vowels in a string
3. Write a code to check if a given string is a palindrome or not
4. Write a code to check if two given string are anagrams of each other
5. Write a code to find all occurrence of a given substring within another string  
6. Write a code to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated character
7. Write a code to determine if a string has all unique characters
8. write a code to convert a given string to uppercase or lowercase
9. write a code to count the number of words in a string
10. Write a code to concatenate two string without using the + operator
11. Write a code to remove all occurrences of a specific element from a list
12. Implentent a code to find the second largest number in a given list of integers
13. Create a code to count the occurrences of each element in a list and return a dictionary with elements as key and their counts as a value
14. Write a code to reverse a list in place without using any built in reverse function
15. Implement a code to find and remove duplicates from a list while preserving the original order of elements
16. Create a code to check if a given list is sorted (either in ascending or descending order) or not
17. Write a code to merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list
18. Implement a code to find the intersection of two given list
19. Create a code to find the intersection of two lists without duplicates
20. Write a code to shuffle a given list randomly without using any built in shuffle functions
21. Write a code to that takes two tuples as input and return a new tuple containing elements that are common to both input tuples
22. Create a code that prompts the user to enter two sets of integers separated by commas then, print the intersection of these two sets 
23. Write a code to conctenate two tuples. the function should take two tuple as input and return a new tuple containing elements from both input tuples
24. Develop a code that prompts the user to input two sets of strings then, print the elements that are present in the first set but not in the second set
25. Create a code that takes a tuple and two integers as input. the function should return a new tuple containing elements from the original tuple within the specified range of indices
26. Write a code that prompts the user to input two sets of characters then print the union of these two sets
27. Develop a code that takes a tuple of integer as input. the function should return the maximum and minimum values from the tuple using tuple unpacking
28. Create a code that defines two sets of integers. then, print the union, intersection, and difference of these two sets 
29. Write a code that takes a tuple and an element as input. the function should return the count of occurrences of the given element in the tuple
30. Develop a code that prompts the user to input two sets of string. then, print the symmetric difference of these two sets
31. Write a code that takes a list of words as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are unique words and the values are the frequencies of those words in the input lists
32. Write a code that takes two dictionaries as input and merges them into a single dictionary. if there are common keys, the values should be added together
33. Write a code to access a value in a nested dictionary. the function should take the dictionary and a list of keys as input, and return the corresponding value.if any keys do not exist in the dictionary, the function should return none 
34. Write a code that takes a dictionary as input and return a sorted version of it based on the values. you can choose whether to sort in ascending or descending order
35. Write a code that inverts a dictionary, swapping keys and values. ensure that the invertd dictionary correctly handels cases where multiple keys have the same value by storing the keys as a list in the nverted dictionary
